One, two, one, two, three, four
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you everyday now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow
And we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
(Patience)
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes, I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it
I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it
Little patience
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience
I've been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right (a little patience)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd (could use some patience)
And the streets don't change, but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (gotta have more patience)
Yeah, yeah, but I need you
Oh, I need you (all it takes is patience)
Oh, I need you (just a little patience)
Oh, this time (is all you need)
